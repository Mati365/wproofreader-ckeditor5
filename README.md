## Install instructions

1. Install the npm module.

	```
	npm install wproofreader-ckeditor5
	```

2. Add a new plugin and its configuration to CKEditor.

	Set the WProofreader configuration data into the `wproofreader` field of the CKEditor 5 config. All available options are described in [API docs](https://webspellchecker.com/docs/api/wscbundle/Options.html).

	For the **Cloud-based** version of WProofreader:

	```js
	import WProofreader from 'wproofreader-ckeditor5';
	...

	ClassicEditor
		.create( editorElement, {
			plugins: [ ..., WProofreader],
			wproofreader: {
				serviceId: 'your-service-ID',
				srcUrl: 'https://svc.webspellchecker.net/spellcheck31/wscbundle/wscbundle.js'
			}
		})
	```

	`serviceId` is a mandatory parameter for activating and using the plugin pointed to the Cloud-based version of WProofreader.

	For the **Server-based** version of WProofreader:

	```js
	import WProofreader from 'wproofreader-ckeditor5';
	...

	ClassicEditor
		.create( editorElement, {
			plugins: [ ..., WProofreader],
			wproofreader: {
				serviceProtocol: 'https',
				serviceHost: 'localhost',
				servicePort: '2880',
				servicePath: '/',
				srcUrl: 'https://host_name/virtual_directory/wscbundle/wscbundle.js'
			}
		})
	```

	Unlike the Cloud-based version, the `serviceId` parameter is not used here. **Instead, it is required to specify the path to the back-end hosted on the clientâ€™s end.**
