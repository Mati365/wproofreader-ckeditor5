This is a pilot version of the WProofreader plugin for CKEditor 5. The main differences between plugin and classic WProofreader are:

* Shipped and configured as a plugin for CKEditor 5.
* Tailored theme based on styles of CKEditor 5.
* Compatible with the [multi-root editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/framework/multi-root-editor.html).
* Automatically disabled the dialog mode of WProofreader when the real-time collaboration features or multi-root editor are turned on.
